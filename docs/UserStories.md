As a player, I want to play Ludo with the official rules.
As a player, I want the program to do all the logic for the players.
You should be able to play as two, three or four players.
To leave the nest you have to throw a six.
If you hit a six you'll be allowed to throw the dice again.
If you have one of your own pices blocking your way you'll have to move the one that have progressed the fursthest.
