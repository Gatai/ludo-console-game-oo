As a player, I want to play Ludo with the official rules.

The program should do all the logic for the players.

You should be able to play as two, three or four players.

The players who throws the highest dice gets to start the round.

To leave the nest you have to throw a six.

If you hit a six you'll be allowed to throw the dice again.

If you have one of your own pices blocking your way you'll have to move the one that have progressed the fursthest.

If you have two of your pieces on that same position you block the path for other players.

Once all your pieces are in the middle circle you've won.

When you've completed a lap around the gameboard you'll have to move towards the center with even dice throws.

Once you've completed 40 steps you can start to move towards the middle.

After 40 steps you have 5 steps to get into the middle.
